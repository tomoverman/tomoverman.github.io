<h2>Incoming Scientist at Epsilon on the Decision Sciences Team</h2>
<h2>PhD in Applied Mathematics from Northwestern University (graduated 2025)</h2>
My PhD was focused on various topics in machine learning. I developed and analyzed federated learning algorithms and developed new automated feature engineering approaches. See my publications below for more details.
